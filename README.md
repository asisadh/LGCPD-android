When you initially open the app. The first view you see is List of District. In title bar as you can see the app says SM. So, when you click the list of district the respective sm of the district are shown. And on clicking the SM, a detail information of the SM is shown.

So, now lets get back to the Home screen again, slide your finger from right to left (or press that arrow button on top right corner.) from there we can select District, Municipality, Region and other. A small title bar says which one is selected. You can change them by just touching over them.

Again, swipe from left to right (or press the 3 bar button). This is our main navigation bar. If user is logged in the information of the user is displayed. From there we can change LSP/SM mode. The title Bar shows our selection.. same way as in SM we can select district/municipality and then name of SM/LSP and their detail.

In detail view, there is a star in right corner, click that and the SM/LSP is stored in our favorite bar.

From home, click the favorite.. the data are organized and categorized by SM and LSP. These stored data are stored in local database. So don't need internet to view them.

Login is also build, for the Administration, but Admin is not completed, that will be completed after our exam in over.

P.S. All the district and municipality doesn't have SM/LSP so they may be empty when entered. And some of them have unsupportive font which are rendered as ????? . This is not the final app, many bugs are to be fixed. The app is only for demo purpose.
